Make a searchable address book from a contact spreadsheet.

CityBook aims to make it easier for administrative staff who maintain contact lists to create a searchable, mobile-responsive web app that uses their spreadsheet as a data source.

Based on the CfA [2015 Richmond Fellowship team's](http://rva.codeforamerica.org) [Search-RVAHealth project](https://github.com/codeforamerica/search-rvahealth).

### What is this built with?

This project uses [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) for the spreadsheet access, [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for some templating, [List.js](http://www.listjs.com/) for the searchable list, and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the styles.

The instruction page template was generated by using the [Cayman theme](https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-cayman-theme) by [Jason Long](http://github.com/jasonlong).
